# PySpark tutorial

Tutorial on using PySpark to analyze car sales offers from Craigslist.org.

## Get ready

You need the current version of the Python 3 installed on your machine. If you don't have it already installed go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You also need to install JupyterLab and PySpark. Recommended option is to use pip from the command line prompt:  

    pip install jupyterlab pyspark

If you had these packages already installed you may want to update them to the most recent version:  

    pip install --upgrade jupyterlab pyspark

To run the JupyterLab:

    jupyter-lab

Default browser should start and connect to the JupyterLab server in the new tab.

Lastly, it's always a good idea to have the [documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-getting-started.html) open in another tab of the browser.
